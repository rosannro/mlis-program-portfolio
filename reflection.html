                    My MLIS program at University of Missouri provided a wealth of insights into the library & information sciences (LIS) field. In addition to educational coursework, I received invaluable education from guest speakers who currently work in the profession, advice from my faculty advisor on my coursework and what to expect once I enter the field, and practical experience acquired from a one-year internship at Oberlin Regional Library in Raleigh and a semester practicum at Duke University's Lilly Library. Overall, my education gave me a solid footing in coursework that covered the foundations and history of LIS, collections management, organization of information and LIS technology, management and interdisciplinary principles and best practices, and reference and resource services.

                    There were several courses and assignments in the program that particularly stood out for me. In my Introduction to Information Technology course, I enjoyed all of the projects, but the most stimulating one was a paper examining the usability and accessibility of the University of Missouri Library's integrated library system (ILS). Using Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design, I assessed the ILS to see if the library's system passed or failed in meeting each of the heuristics. Furthermore, I evaluated the library's ILS and website to see if it met accessibility standards by using the WAVE Accessibility Evaluation Tool. The Collections & Access Management course allowed me to better comprehend how collections are developed and managed. My assignments entailed a community profile, collection evaluation, and collection management policy. Of all the courses in the MLIS program, the Reference Sources and Services course was my favorite. The reference interview techniques I learned taught me how to ask patrons open and closed questions so that I can narrow the search and ensure I am locating the appropriate resource. I also enjoyed the assignments from this course the most in the program, especially creating my Religion in the Roman Empire LibGuide and the reference sources exam that included 40 questions on researching and comparing/contrasting various reference resources and databases, locating resources, and determining which resources to acquire based on audience level. Lastly, I took a Research Problems in Information Science and Learning Technology course. I conducted independent research and wrote a literature review on challenges in information literacy pertaining to Indigenous students in higher education.

                    The program allowed me to conduct a one-year paid public library internship at Oberlin Regional Library and a practicum at Duke University's Lilly Library. My education assisted me in carrying out my internship work and, in turn, the work I performed at my internship gave me additional insights that I was able to use in my studies. During the Oberlin internship, I was able to use much of what I learned in the Reference Sources and Services course. The courseâ€™s assignments introduced me to numerous research and subject databases that proved to be helpful when I answered reference questions. Learning how to conduct a reference interview was also highly beneficial, for I was able to reduce the amount of time it took to answer patrons' reference question and locate the information or resource they sought. Like my public library internship, I was able to apply the knowledge I acquired from my courses to my practicum work at Duke University's Lilly Library. I utilized the research skills I learned in the Reference Sources and Services course when I needed to fulfill a professor's research request. The Collections & Access Management course was instrumental when I performed a large-scale collections transfer/withdrawal project to prepare Lilly for its closure for renovations. In addition to gleaning a few of the daily operations of an academic library, my practicum also gave me the unique opportunity to witness what transpires during a library's closure for renovations.

                    I believe my MLIS coursework has prepared me for a successful career as a librarian. The program afforded me with a strong overview of the LIS field and the values libraries and librarians strive for. I acquired skills that have already proven to be essential to me in my current library work and will continue to be valuable in my future career as an information sciences professional.
