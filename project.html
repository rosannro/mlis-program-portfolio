                    <h3>Student Learning Objective 1:</h3>
                    <p>Graduates will apply the core principles, ethics, values, and body of knowledge to questions in library and information science, according to their area of specialty.</p>
                    <h3>Project:</h3>
                    <p>Librarians & Fake News Literature Review</p>
                    <h3>Description:</h3>
                    <p>This literature review assesses how effective information literacy (IL) is in combatting misinformation. My review argues the stance that IL is ineffective for teaching the public how to evaluate misinformation. To further support this stance, literature discussing whether IL has been successful in instructing consumers of information on how to spot and analyze misinformation has been examined. This paper also investigates several research questions, identifies research gaps, and makes recommendations to correct these gaps. Although the literature review draws the conclusion that information literacy alone is not often effective in counteracting misinformation, it also illustrates the significance for information science professionals to continually seek information to find solutions to problems in the field, since the literature review recommends persistence in conducting research to learn new methods to combat misinformation.</p>
                    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                    <p>The assignment allowed me to understand the significance of librarians’ societal responsibility for imparting factual and authoritative information to the public. The assignment emphasized to me that one of the key components of information science professionals' work is to provide information and educate users so they have the knowledge to analyze information and locate trustworthy sources. This reinforced to me the dual role of information science professionals as providers and seekers of information. I currently employ SLO 1 in my work as a public library assistant by delivering sound information to patrons and instructing them how to use research databases.</p>

                    <h3>Project:</h3>
                    <p>Duke University Libraries Practicum Video PowerPoint Presentation</p>
                    <h3>Description:</h3>
                    <p>This presentation was completed near the end of my practicum at Duke University’s Lilly Library for Duke’s annual Graduate Student Lightning Talks program. My presentation discusses the collections management transfer project I worked on ahead of the library’s summer closure for renovations. It also discusses other projects including fulfilling a professor’s request to research and compile a bibliography of difficult to locate resources on a feminist author, writing the monthly “What to Read” blog post and a post informing students how to access research resources after they graduate, reviewing book lists to make acquisition recommendations, and purchasing e-books for Overdrive.</p>
                    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                    <p>My presentation allowed me to reflect on the various duties I had during my practicum, which gave me managerial insight into how collections management decisions are made, especially when collections need to be transferred and withdrawn, developing criteria for acquisitions and weeding, and how managers must constantly think of ways to offer further guidance and information to students to ensure they are equipping them with the tools they need to succeed in school.</p>

                    <p>Virtual Reality Video PowerPoint Presentation</p>
                    <h3>Description:</h3>
                    <p>My presentation’s topic features the emerging technology of virtual reality (VR) in the library and information sciences field. It begins with an overview of VR and then discusses how the technology is currently being used in both information sciences (academic and public libraries and museums) and non-information science settings (architecture, business, education, healthcare, military, and psychotherapy). The presentation also assesses VR equipment and vendors, as well as the benefits it offers to users. Challenges that information science agencies and other fields encounter when trying to implement and/or utilize VR are also examined. Finally, the future of the technology is projected.</p>
                    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                    <p>This project demonstrated to me how information science professionals support their continuing education by staying abreast of new technologies in information sciences to ensure the services they are offering to patrons remain relevant. I acquired new technology skills by learning how to use PowerPoint, convert the PowerPoint to video, and upload the video to YouTube. Obtaining these skills has instilled confidence in me to learn new technologies. As a result of this project, I have learned HTML, and I will continue to embrace and further my education in technologies during my LIS career.</p>

                    <h3>Project:</h3>
                    <p>Religion in the Roman Empire LibGuide</p>
                    <h3>Description:</h3>
                    <p>This project is a compilation of research resources on the topic religion in the Roman Empire for a LibGuide. The project involved research to locate appropriate reference resources for the topic and my LibGuide’s target audience of academic library users, researchers, and scholars. The LibGuide is divided into seven pages—a home page welcoming users and giving a brief overview of the site and six pages divided by resource formats (Books & Journals, Dictionaries & Encyclopedias, Databases, Archives, Atlases, & Maps, and Electronic Resources & Books on Roman Civilization). These pages identify the resources and provide links taking users to the resources. In addition to identifying subject and research databases and offering their links, the database page contains a video tutorial on the JSTOR research database.</p>
                    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                    <p>This project taught me how to locate and access various reference resources and how to evaluate sources to ensure the information I provided on my LibGuide was authoritative and pertinent to my topic and audience. The LibGuide assignment also gave me experience in instructing users how to use a reference tool, since I created a video tutorial on how to use the JSTOR research database. In my current public library position, I use the knowledge acquired from SLO 4 and this project when I select reference sources and instruct patrons on how to do research and utilize reference tools.</p>
