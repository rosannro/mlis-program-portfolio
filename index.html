            <p>Welcome to my Master of Library Sciences (MLIS) program portfolio website! Here you can view the work I completed during my MLIS program and learn more about me and my professional aspirations and background. My website’s purpose is to showcase projects demonstrating my mastery of the four student learning objectives (SLOs) of University of Missouri’s MLIS program, as well as discuss highlights for me in my coursework and assignments. The website will also provide a short biography, a PDF resume, and video resume, which will outline my professional background, educational experiences, and avocational interests. The SLOs cover foundations of library and information science, management principles, library technology and information organization, and reference services. Each SLO will be represented by a project reflecting my acquired knowledge for that respective objective and give my thoughts on what I feel was most valuable to me in my learning process and future librarianship career.</p>
            <p>I decided to have a program portfolio website so that prospective employers will have an opportunity to view my work and to offer them a better idea of my strengths related to the library science field. In addition to featuring my projects, the website will also contain reflective essays conveying how I have already used the expertise gained from the SLOs in my current library work and my overall experiences with the MLIS program. My hope is that once prospective employers view my website, they will have a solid understanding of my professional and educational background and my potential as an LIS professional.</p>
